# 1 Introduction

This assignment aims to develop our understanding of assessing the effectiveness of a white-box test suite through code coverage. It builds on the automated unit testing principles from Assignment 2, using the JUnit tool in Eclipse. Unlike Assignment 2, here we focus on enhancing the test suite and creating test cases based on various white-box testing criteria, including control flow (statement, decision, condition, and method coverage) and data flow (DU pairs coverage). Implementing white-box testing allows us to validate unit tests at the unit testing level. The coverage tools also identify the extent of completed unit testing and highlight areas that require attention. Overall, white-box testing facilitates a more thorough and in-depth testing phase in the software development cycle by examining all possible code paths.


# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

  ##2.1. DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column, int[] validRows)

  The three-argument calculateColumnTotal method was chosen out of the two methods with the same name. The following are
  the steps and calculations to calculate the all-uses coverage for this method.
