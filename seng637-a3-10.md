# 1 Introduction

This assignment aims to develop our understanding of assessing the effectiveness of a white-box test suite through code coverage. It builds on the automated unit testing principles from Assignment 2, using the JUnit tool in Eclipse. Unlike Assignment 2, here we focus on enhancing the test suite and creating test cases based on various white-box testing criteria, including control flow (statement, decision, condition, and method coverage) and data flow (DU pairs coverage). Implementing white-box testing allows us to validate unit tests at the unit testing level. The coverage tools also identify the extent of completed unit testing and highlight areas that require attention. Overall, white-box testing facilitates a more thorough and in-depth testing phase in the software development cycle by examining all possible code paths.


# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

  2.1. DataUtilities.calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column, int[] validRows)

  The three-argument calculateColumnTotal method was chosen out of the two methods with the same name. The following are
  the steps and calculations to calculate the all-uses coverage for this method.

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test


The overarching testing approach for this assignment involved utilizing EclEmma on the initial set of Assignment 2 tests designed for the source code within the Assignment 3 artifacts. Upon obtaining coverage results for the 'before' state from the code coverage tool, we proceeded to enhance or supplement the existing tests for the selected 10 methods identified in Assignment 2. These methods are: 

Range

- `expandToInclude(Range range, double value)`
- `expand(Range range, double lowerMargin, double upperMargin)`
- `intersects(double b0, double b1)`
- `shift(Range base, double delta, boolean allowsZeroCrossing)`
- `scale(Range base, double factor)`

DataUtilities

- `calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column, int[] validRows)`
- `calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row, int[] validCols)`
- `createNumberArray(double[] data)`
- `createNumberArray2D(double[][] data)`
- `getCumulativePercentages(KeyedValues data)`

The following is the list of new methods covered.

Range

- `combine(Range range1, Range range2)`
- `combineIgnoringNaN(Range range1, Range range2)`
- `constrain(double value)`
- `contains(double value)`
- `equals(Object obj)`
- `getCentralValue()`
- `getLength()`
- `getLowerBound()`
- `getUpperBound()`
- `hashCode()`
- `intersects(Range range)`
- `isNaNRange()`
- `shift(Range base, double delta)`

DataUtilities

- `calculateColumnTotal(Values2D data, int column)`
- `calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row)`
- `clone(double[][] source)`
- `equal(double[][] a, double[][] b)`

The overarching strategy employed during the creation of new unit tests involved a systematic process. We initiated by running the code coverage tool, visually analyzing the coverage results, and subsequently crafting a test that targeted a line, branch, or condition lacking coverage. Following the development of a new unit test, we reran the code coverage tool to assess the impact of the test on coverage. Test development for a specific method concluded once satisfactory coverage was achieved for that method. Similarly, unit test writing for an entire class was deemed complete upon achieving overall coverage for the class. Periodic revisions to unit tests were undertaken as necessary.

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

1. `expandTestNegativeLB_LowerBoundUM_LowerGreaterThanUpper()`

Before the unit test was written, the following were the coverage metrics (line, branch and method coverage, as well as
instruction and complexity) from EclEmma.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Line:            | 75%          |
| Branch:          | 50%          |
| Method:          | 100%         |
| Instruction:     | 75%          |
| Complexity:      | 50%          |


The new test case covers this path by expanding a unit range with a large negative lower bound value (-1.1) and then
applying this range to an existing range of (-10, 10).

The new coverage metrics are as follows.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Line:            | 100%         |
| Branch:          | 100%         |
| Method:          | 100%         |
| Instruction:     | 100%         |
| Complexity:      | 100%         |

2. `expandToIncludeWithNullRangeInputNominalValue()`
Before the unit test was written, the following were the coverage metrics (line, branch and method coverage, as well as
instruction and complexity) from EclEmma.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%) |
|------------------|--------------|
| Line:            | 85.7%        |
| Branch:          | 83.3%        |
| Method:          | 100%         |
| Instruction:     | 82.4%        |
| Complexity:      | 75.0%        |

We already met the recommended minimum branch coverage of 70% for the `expandToInclude(Range range, double value)` method. 
However, we failed to test the first boundary value in the method (see java code below for method) i.e a null range input.

```java
.......
        if (range == null) {
        return new Range(value, value);
        }
        ........
```
So, we added a new test case, `expandToIncludeWithNullRangeInputNominalValue()` that takes a null Range and a nominal 
value (0) as argument, considering a setUp Range value of (-10, 10). The result was a Range value of (0, 0) which is accurate.

The new coverage metrics are as follows.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%)  |
|------------------|---------------|
| Line:            | 100%          |
| Branch:          | 100%          |
| Method:          | 100%          |
| Instruction:     | 100%          |
| Complexity:      | 100%          |


3. `calculateRowTotalWithNegativeColumnCount()`
Before the unit test was written, the following were the coverage metrics (line, branch and method coverage, as well as
instruction and complexity) from EclEmma.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%) |
|------------------|--------------|
| Line:            | 91.7%        |
| Branch:          | 87.5%        |
| Method:          | 100%         |
| Instruction:     | 95.1%        |
| Complexity:      | 80%          |

While we successfully achieved the recommended minimum branch coverage of 70% for the calculateRowTotal(Values2D data, int row, int[] validCols) method, a notable omission exists. Specifically, we overlooked testing the boundary scenario involving a column count less than zero, as indicated in the Java code snippet provided below. In other words, we failed to address the case where the column count is negative.

```java
..............
        int colCount = data.getColumnCount();
        if (colCount < 0){
        total = 0.0;
        }
        .................

```

To address this gap, we introduced a new test case named calculateRowTotalWithNegativeColumnCount(). This test case incorporates a negative column count within the int[] validCols argument. The negative value is interpreted as a column count less than 0, resulting in the assignment of total = 0.0. Consequently, the test case ensures that the method returns a total row value of zero for the specified column in scenarios where the column count is negative.

The new coverage metrics are as follows.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%)  |
|------------------|---------------|
| Line:            | 100%          |
| Branch:          | 100%          |
| Method:          | 100%          |
| Instruction:     | 100%          |
| Complexity:      | 100%          |


4. `testingUpperBound()`

Before the unit test was written, the following were the coverage metrics (line, branch and method coverage, as well as
instruction and complexity) from EclEmma.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Line:            | 40%          |
| Branch:          | 50%          |
| Method:          | 100%         |
| Instruction:     | 40%          |
| Complexity:      | 50%          |

The original source code for this method was entirely devoid of test coverage. Given its status as a helper method, directly invoking the function with incorrect values to observe exception behavior proved unfeasible. Instead, the upper limit had to be manually adjusted with an incorrect value post the initialization of the Range object with the correct values. To facilitate this process, we introduced a new method named setUpper().
```java
    @Test(expected=IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void testingUpperBound() {
    	testRange6.setUpper(1.0);
    	testRange6.getUpperBound();
    }
// New function defined to test "getUpperBound()"
        public void setUpper(double value){
    	this.upper = value;
    }
```

This new test case covers this path by introducing a upper bound value (1.0) that is lower than the lower bound of range (2.0,4.0). The new coverage metrics are as follows.

| Coverage Measure | Coverage (%) |
| ---------------- | ------------ |
| Line:            | 100%         |
| Branch:          | 100%         |
| Method:          | 100%         |
| Instruction:     | 100%         |
| Complexity:      | 100%         |

5. `testIsNaNRangeBothNaN()`
The provided test case examines a Range type object to ascertain whether it contains a NaN value, utilizing the isNaNRange() method. This method returns true if the Range object possesses NaN at either the lower or upper boundary. The specific test case scrutinizes a Range object configured with both upper and lower boundary values set as NaN to ensure comprehensive coverage of branches within the method.

This decision was driven by the method's previous lab coverage, which stood at 0%. A thorough examination of the coverage information for the isNaNRange method revealed that the return statement was left uncovered. Following the development of the necessary test cases, we successfully achieved 100% coverage for the entire method.
```java
    @Test
    public void testIsNaNRangeBothNaN() {
    	Range range = new Range(Double.NaN, Double.NaN);
    	assertTrue(range + " is not a NaNRange.", range.isNaNRange());
    }
```
